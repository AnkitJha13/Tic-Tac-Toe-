# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Demo
You can try out the game by visiting the ["live demo."]("https://ankitjha13.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-/")

# How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each cell represents a position on the board.

- The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.

- Players take turns alternately, marking an empty cell with their respective symbol (X or O).

- The objective is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- If all cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

- To restart the game, simply refresh the page.
